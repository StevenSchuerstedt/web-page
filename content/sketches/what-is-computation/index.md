GÃ¶dels imcompletness theorem, true statements that cannot be proven

=> question about number theory, goldbach conjecture etc

turing machine => halting problem, undecidable

halting problem is a well defined problem, all needed information is given, and the answer can be yes / no, but still no algorithm possible.

(compare to things like, what is the meaning of life? does god exist? => ok there is no algorithm for that&#8230;.)

asking wether a TM halts or not seems innocent, but you ask for a prove for every math problem there is. (goldbach conjecture) 

related to alot of other problems, solving polynomial equations, wang tiles etc

=> always problem of self reference

Cantor set theory

Why is this stuff helpful?

It reflects about what an algorithm is, what we do when we add two numbers etc. When we understand what algorithms are and how they work, we can construct machines to execute that algorithm. 

=> first mechanical calculaters, baggage, difference machine

=> computer uses circuits, boolean algebra, idea of universality
